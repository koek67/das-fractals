{"name":"Das-fractals","tagline":"","body":"### What is this?\r\nA 3D fractal viewer thingy. This project centers around the types of fractals known as L-System fractals. These types of fractals are unique in that they can be described using a predefined set of parameters. This project will let you adjust these parameters and make oh-so-cool fractals....in 3D!\r\n\r\n### Why am I doing this?\r\nI guess I just like doing stuff like this in my free time. But more importantly, this is a part of my Senior Project curriculum at my high school. Basically, students in this program have to make something by the end of the year and this is what I chose to to. Each project is supposed to answer a research question known as an Essential Question. Mine is:\r\n\r\nTo what extent can I make my own 3D fractals and write programs to model it?\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
